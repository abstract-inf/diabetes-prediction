# Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting diabetes using machine learning models.

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on various health parameters. The model is built and trained using data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- mlflow

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow mlflow
```
## Usage

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abstract-inf/diabetes-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook diabetes-prediction.ipynb
   ```
Additionaly, you can also try using `test_model.ipynb` to test a random sample of the data on the model.
